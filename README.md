# Project Details

## Project Title: Studental

## Problem Statement:
Students face challenges regarding their interests/career decisions, this includes the difficulties of 
accessing relevant opportunities to ease the transition from university to the real work environment, 
the need to bridge the gap between their theoretical background and practical skills, as well as to gain 
experience to prepare for their dream job or reach a certain level (e.g., senior position):

1-Diverse Opportunities: There are various opportunities available to students, including internships, 
training, employment opportunities, competitions, summer schools, conferences, and workshops. This shows 
the breadth of options students have but also the potential complexity in finding the right fit. 

2-Fragmented Information: These opportunities are scattered across numerous websites and social media
platforms, making it difficult for students to track them down. This fragmentation adds an extra layer 
of difficulty in accessing relevant information. 

3-Time and Effort: Searching through hundreds of websites, verifying the accuracy and validity of information,
and navigating through different formats and sources can be time-consuming and tedious for students. This 
can lead to demotivation and frustration. 

4-Relevance: Many opportunities may not be relevant to Albanian students due to specific requirements or 
restrictions, such as those designed for EU or international students. This further complicates the search 
process and adds to the time wasted. 

5-Importance of Opportunities: The significance of these opportunities in helping students is important in 
exploring their career paths, passions, and interests. This emphasizes the importance of streamlining the 
process for students to access relevant opportunities efficiently.


## Solution Proposed:
The solution proposed to address the identified problem is a platform designed to connect students with 
internship, scholarship, employment, training opportunities, and more in Albania. This platform aims to 
help students explore their passions and interests, facilitating their success in their careers. Users 
will have the chance to discover opportunities not only within the borders of Albania but also wherever
Albania is eligible to participate globally. The website aims to streamline the search process by 
consolidating all available opportunities in one user-friendly interface, while continuously gathering 
feedback from users and stakeholders to improve and enhance the platform's functionality, usability, and 
relevance to students' needs. If the application is intended to be a web app, it will be built with
WordPress,otherwise if it's intended to be a mobile app, it will be built with React Native, this will 
be determined after the first phase.


## Project Scope:
- **Aim:** The overall aim of the project is to develop a centralized platform, utilizing either WordPress
  for web application development or React Native for mobile application development, aimed at connecting
  students in Albania with a diverse range of internship, scholarship, employment, and training opportunities.
  This platform seeks to streamline the process of accessing relevant opportunities, empower students in
  their career exploration and decision-making

- **Main Objectives:**
1. To develop a centralized platform: Create a centralized platform accessible via web (using WordPress)
   or mobile (using React Native) to aggregate internship, scholarship, employment, and training
   opportunities for students in Albania.
2. To ensure scalability and sustainability: Design the platform with scalability and sustainability in mind,
   allowing for future enhancements and updates to meet evolving user needs and technological advancements.
3. To adhere to timelines and budget: Ensure timely delivery of the project within the allocated budget,
   adhering to project timelines and resource constraints.


## Application Description:
The scope of this project encompasses the development of a platform aimed at connecting students in Albania with internship, 
scholarship, employment, training opportunities, and more. The platform will serve as a centralized hub for students to 
explore various opportunities related to their career interests and academic pursuits.

#Boundaries and Limitations:          
1-Geographical Limitation: The platform will focus primarily on opportunities available within Albania, with the inclusion 
 of international opportunities accessible to Albanian students.   
2-Technology Limitation: The platform will be developed either as a web application using WordPress or as a mobile application 
 using React Native, as previously specified.        
3-Initial Release: The scope of the initial release will focus on essential features to establish the platform's functionality
 and usability, with the potential for future iterations to incorporate additional features and enhancements.      
4-Accessibility: While the platform aims to be accessible to all students, including those with disabilities, the scope will 
 prioritize adherence to accessibility standards and guidelines within the chosen development framework.

#Key Features and Functionalities:          
1-User Registration and Profiles: Allow students to create accounts and edit their profiles with relevant information such 
  as education background, interests, etc.     
-Opportunity Listings: Provide a comprehensive list/blog of internship, scholarship, employment, and training opportunities,
 categorized and searchable based on various criteria such as application deadline, field, and eligibility.        
2-Search and Filtering: Implement search and filtering functionalities to enable students to narrow down opportunities based
 on their preferences and requirements.       
3-User Dashboard: Offer a user-friendly dashboard where students can manage their saved opportunities, applications,etc.   
4-Accessibility Features: Ensure accessibility features are integrated into the platform, such as keyboard navigation, screen 
 reader compatibility, and alternative text for images.                
5-Community Engagement: Facilitate community engagement through features such as sharing opportunities.
6-Mobile Responsiveness (if web app): Ensure the web application is mobile-responsive, allowing users to access the platform 
 seamlessly across different devices and screen sizes.
